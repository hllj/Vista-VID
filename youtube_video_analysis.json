The camera then widens, showing the immense scale of the eruption and a group of tourists hastily walking across the barren volcanic landscape, seemingly evacuating from the danger. The bright blue sky provides a stark backdrop to the towering, ominous plumes of ash and rock. Vietnamese text overlays identify the source and highlight the event as a \"huge eruption at Europe's most active volcano,\" while a narrator describes the June 2nd eruption of Mount Etna in Sicily, Italy, and the subsequent flight of tourists.",

A group of individuals, dressed in casual attire, are seen walking briskly across the dark, rocky terrain, moving away from the colossal grey ash cloud that dominates the background against a clear blue sky. The camera maintains a steady, slightly wide shot, emphasizing the vastness of the volcanic landscape and the towering plume of smoke, dust, and rocks. The Vietnamese narrator concurrently describes how the video shows \"many people rushing down the mountain as a giant column of smoke, dust, and rocks several kilometers high rises into the air,\" directly aligning the audio with the visual evidence of the ongoing eruption and the tourists' hasty departure. This continuous shot reinforces the immediate danger and the scale of the natural event.",

Their pace appears to have become less frantic, suggesting they are now at a safer distance or have completed the most urgent part of their evacuation. The camera maintains a steady, slightly wide shot, panning subtly to the right to follow the group as they progress across the barren landscape. The Vietnamese narrator provides crucial updates, confirming that \"all tourists and climbers present on the volcano when it erupted were safely evacuated\" (0:41). The narration then shifts to official reassurances, stating that \"A local official stated that the dangerous area was limited to the summit of Etna, which had been closed to tourists to prevent risks, and the lava flows during the eruption did not pose a danger to residential areas\" (0:42-0:52).

The Vietnamese narrator concludes the report by stating that \"According to the observatory, the eruption gradually decreased in the late evening, the lava flows have now cooled down, and the seismic intensity has decreased to a low level\" (0:53-0:59). This audio-visual alignment provides a reassuring resolution to the dramatic events, confirming the decline of the volcanic activity and the safety of the area, effectively bringing the narrative to a close.",
